# Cydia SwiftUI (Cydia but Modern)
## This is NOT a working Cydia Client, its a Template in case anyone wants to make it a real Cydia Client, its built with SwiftUI for iOS 15 and up

This App is based on sunstar16's CydiaWeb (https://sunstar16.github.io/CydiaWeb/) as i don't have a real Cydia Device to compare to. All Packages and URLs as well as Links are Placeholders and almost 100% taken from Cydia Web by sunstar16

It uses native SwiftUI Elements and has iOS 18 Tinted Icon Support

## How to try it out/check out the UI
Either download the ipa from the [Releases](https://appetize.io/app/b_bcdm3xqogwq4q5ttrd2srmince) Tab or click the appetize.io link there to try it in an online simulator
